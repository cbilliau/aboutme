  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p>My name is Chris Billiau. I live on the Connecitcut shoreline where I raise three unique high-powered mutant, never meant for production, children with my lovely wife.</p>
  <p>I've never felt comfortable staying in one place, doing just one thing, or being the same person I was yesterday. It is a perpetual pull, like and attenuated echo, that subtly moves me to next thing... like dropping everything and becoming a web developer.</p>
